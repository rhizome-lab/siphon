# /polish

You are running an incremental codebase polish session. This is one step of a fixpoint loop — audit, review with user, apply, repeat.

## Step 1: Orient

Check for an existing `POLISH.md` in the project root:

- If it **exists**: read it, note the lenses used last time, the round number, and the git hash or timestamp recorded. Run `git log --oneline <recorded-hash>..HEAD` (or `git log --since=<timestamp> --oneline` if hash unavailable) to summarize what changed since last polish. Present this summary to the user before anything else: what changed, which lenses were run last time.
- If it **does not exist**: note this is a fresh session.

Also check the project type: Rust library, CLI tool, web frontend, CLAUDE.md / documentation, etc. Infer from the file structure.

## Step 2: Agree on lenses

Present the user with lens options based on project type. Suggest a preset but let them choose or customize. Do not proceed until confirmed.

### Universal lenses

These apply to any codebase:

- **api-clarity** — public surface legibility from an external consumer's perspective: naming, ergonomics, discoverability
- **api-gaps** — public surface completeness: missing operations, asymmetric coverage, things you'd expect to exist that don't
- **consistency** — are patterns, contracts, error handling, and validation applied uniformly across analogous components? (goes beyond naming — behavioral consistency)
- **doc-coverage** — public items documented? examples work? links valid?
- **ui-text** — audit UI-visible strings (status bars, tooltips, dialogs, labels). Flag text that exists outside the functional inventory: labels, inputs, navigation, non-visible status, errors with remediation. Tutorials, narration of visible state, encouragement, and redundant descriptions are noise — recommend deletion, not rewording.
- **error-surface** — error types complete, meaningful, and consistent?
- **completeness** — what inputs or cases does this code silently accept that it should validate or reject?
- **adversarial** — make the strongest case against this code
- **overfit** — code over-tuned for one specific scenario at the cost of generality, correctness at edge cases, or readability; algorithms or data structures chosen for a benchmark that doesn't represent real usage
- **interaction-model** — from a user's perspective, what standard capabilities or flows for this kind of software are missing, broken, or incomplete? Compare against the established interaction conventions of the software category, not just the codebase's own API surface.
- **affordance-design** — Good UI answers "what can I do here?" from its own structure. Interactions are typed (commands, gestures, ambient signals, navigation) and each type earns a surface suited to it — forcing everything into command-form is itself a smell. Audit for: surfaces that force hunting instead of scanning; irrelevant items dimmed when they should be absent; layout that shifts unpredictably within a mode; and search or palette load-bearing for primary workflows instead of serving as a long-tail fallback. When a surface feels overwhelming, the fix is fewer composable primitives, not better filtering over a messy graph.
- **legacy-debt** — unannotated legacy code: stale patterns, commented-out blocks, deprecated paths, or dead code with no comment explaining why it's still present. Priority: unannotated legacy actively poisons agent context — an agent seeing an unexplained old pattern treats it as signal and copies it
- **incomplete-migrations** — in-progress transitions where old and new patterns coexist without a clear signal about which is canonical: type/struct renames where both names still appear, call sites not yet updated after an API change, mixed import styles, half-migrated error handling, TODOs referencing an in-flight refactor. Severity scales with breadth — a migration spread across dozens of files where old patterns dominate by count is the worst case: a cold agent surveys the codebase, concludes the old pattern is the house style, and copies it forward, making the migration harder to complete with every session

### Documentation / CLAUDE.md lenses

- **consistency** — internal coherence, cross-reference accuracy, contradictions
- **gaps** — missing guidance, undocumented edge cases, assumed context
- **adversarial** — where literal compliance leads to bad agent behavior
- **agent-clarity** — would a cold agent, reading this for the first time, follow it correctly?

### Custom lenses

The lenses above are starting points. You can define arbitrary lenses based on the project's needs — if a project has a specific concern (performance, accessibility, security, concurrency safety, etc.), propose it as a lens. The user can also suggest their own.

**Presets to offer:**
- `comprehensive` — all applicable lenses
- `quick` — 2 most impactful lenses for the project type
- `custom` — user picks

**If $ARGUMENTS is provided**, try to parse it as a preset name or comma-separated lens list and skip the interactive step if unambiguous.

Also ask: which files or directories to focus on? Default: entire codebase. Narrow scope if the user mentions a module or area.

## Step 3: Run parallel audits

Spawn one Agent per agreed lens, all in parallel (single message, multiple Agent tool calls). Each agent is a `general-purpose` agent.

Each agent prompt should:
- State its single lens clearly at the top
- Specify the file scope agreed in step 2
- Instruct the agent to return findings as a structured list: `file:line — issue — suggested fix` (one finding per line)
- Ask for severity: `high` / `medium` / `low`
- Instruct it to be specific and actionable, not vague
- Instruct it NOT to fix anything — observe and report only
- Instruct it to append a **Skipped** section at the end of its report listing any files, modules, or areas it did not fully examine — due to size, complexity, time, or tedium — so the user knows what wasn't covered

## Step 4: Synthesize

Once all agents complete:

1. Deduplicate findings that multiple lenses flagged (keep the most specific description)
2. Flag any conflicts (lens A says expose X, lens B says hide X) — surface these explicitly to the user
3. Group remaining findings by file or by severity
4. Present a clean summary: total findings by lens and severity, then the full list grouped

## Step 5: User review

Present the findings. The user may:
- Approve findings (will be applied next)
- Reject findings (note reason, won't recur)
- Defer findings (keep for later rounds)
- Ask for clarification on any finding

Do not apply any fixes during this step.

## Step 6: Write POLISH.md

Write or update `POLISH.md` in the project root with:

```markdown
# Polish State

Created: <git hash of HEAD when first created, or ISO timestamp>
Last run: <ISO timestamp>
Round: <N>
Project type: <inferred type>

## Lenses
<list of lenses used this session>

## Scope
<files/directories in scope>

## Findings — Round <N>

### <Lens Name>
- [PENDING] `file:line` — issue — suggested fix _(severity: high)_
- [APPROVED] `file:line` — issue — suggested fix _(severity: medium)_
- [REJECTED] `file:line` — issue — suggested fix _(reason: intentional)_

### Conflicts
- <lens A> vs <lens B>: description of conflict — awaiting user decision
```

If POLISH.md already existed, increment the round number and append the new round's findings. Preserve previous rounds.

## Step 7: Offer next steps

Tell the user:
- How many findings are APPROVED and ready to apply
- That they can ask you to apply approved findings now, or run `/polish` again after applying to re-audit
- If there were conflicts, that those need a decision before proceeding

Do not apply fixes unless the user explicitly asks.
